# Dummy Video Placeholder

This file represents where the dummy_video.mp4 would be located.

In a real implementation, you would:
1. Add a sample video file (dummy_video.mp4) to this assets folder
2. Use expo-av's Video component to display it
3. The video would loop continuously as a background

For now, the HomeScreen uses a gradient background with placeholder text instead of an actual video file.

To add a real video:
1. Place your video file here as dummy_video.mp4
2. Update HomeScreen.js to import and use the Video component from expo-av
3. Set the video to loop and play automatically
